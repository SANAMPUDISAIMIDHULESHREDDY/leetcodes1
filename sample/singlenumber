Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

code :
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = Counter(nums)
        for i in a.elements():
            if a[i]==1:
                return i
