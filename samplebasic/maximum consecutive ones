Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

code:
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        c=0
        max1 = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i==1:
                c+=1
                max1=max(c,max1)
            else:
                c=0
        return max1
