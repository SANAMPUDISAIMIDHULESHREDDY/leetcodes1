You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

code:
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
      left = 0
      right =  1
      max_profit = 0
      while right < len(prices):
        cur = prices[right]-prices[left]
        if prices[left]<prices[right]:
          max_profit = max(max_profit,cur)
        else:
          left = right
        right = right + 1
      return max_profit
